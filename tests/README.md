# Workshop Tests

This folder contains automated tests to verify the workshop functionality.

## test_workshop.sh

Comprehensive test script that validates the entire workshop workflow:

- âœ… Container build and startup
- âœ… Database reset and schema creation
- âœ… Data generation (100k+ records)
- âœ… Schema normalization
- âœ… Index creation
- âœ… Benchmark execution
- âœ… Performance verification

### Running the Tests

```bash
cd tests
./test_workshop.sh
```

### What It Tests

The script simulates a complete workshop run and verifies:

1. **Container Setup**: Builds and starts the workshop container
2. **Database Initialization**: Resets to bad schema with generated data
3. **Normalization**: Loads normalized schema successfully
4. **Indexing**: Creates all required indexes
5. **Performance**: Runs benchmark and checks query times
6. **Cleanup**: Removes test containers and volumes

### Expected Output

```
ðŸ§ª Testing Workshop Functionality
==================================
1. Building and starting workshop container...
âœ… Container built successfully
âœ… Container started successfully
âœ… PostgreSQL is ready
2. Testing database reset...
âœ… Database reset completed
âœ… Bad schema tables created
3. Testing data generation...
âœ… Products generated (100000 records)
âœ… Orders generated (50000 records)
4. Testing schema normalization...
âœ… Normalized schema loaded
âœ… Normalized tables created
5. Testing index creation...
âœ… Indexes created (10 indexes)
6. Testing benchmark functionality...
âœ… Benchmark runs successfully
7. Testing performance improvement...
âœ… Query performance is good (12.345 ms)
8. Cleaning up...
âœ… Cleanup completed

ðŸŽ‰ All workshop tests passed!
```

### Notes

- Tests use a separate container (`workshop-test`) and volume (`workshop-test-data`) to avoid interfering with development
- The test container uses port 5434 to avoid conflicts
- Tests clean up after themselves
- Performance check expects queries under 50ms with indexes (adjust if needed)</content>
